# Promises [[عربي]](readme.ar.md)
A simple Promise library for Alusus Language.

This library provides basic Promises functionality that is independent of the platform where the promises are to be
used (web, backend, etc). It does not provide an event loop; instead, the platform should provide an event loop
with support for this library.
